### Customer lifetime value

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the present value of future purchases for a customer. We compute CLV by taking the sum of expected monthly spending of a customer for the next 24 months discounted to present value.

### Churn

Churn rate is computed as the probability that a customer will **not** make a purchase in the next 24 months. Values near 0 means that the probability of a customer leaving the store is very low (active or loyal customers). Values near 1 means that the probability of a customer leaving the store is very high (at-risk or lost customers).

Metisa predicts the distribution of the time of next purchase for each customer. We do this by fitting the time of next purchase based on factors relating to purchasing history such as purchase frequency, first and last purchase date.

### Customer personas

A customer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers.

Traditionally, the process of coming up with customer personas is a mix of gut feel from touch points with customers, research reports and creative agencies.

We take a data-centric, bottom-up approach to figuring out who customer personas should be. We group existing customers with similar buying patterns and interests and figure out which way of grouping them produces the best fit. Combining this with our predicted customer lifetime value analysis, we know how valuable each of the segments are as well as how valuable a customer in each segment is.

### Product recommendations

Metisa generates product recommendations for each customer based on what similar customers bought. Product recommendations allow you to create content that is tailored to every customer, resulting in 2-5x increases in email click rates.

### Why is an insight not available?

Predictive insights are forecasts made based on historical data. An insight is not available when we need more data to produce a reliable result. This could occur with [customer lifetime value](#customer-lifetime-value), [churn](#churn), [customer personas](#customer-personas) and [recommendations](#recommendations). In our experience, Metisa produces results for stores with over 5,000 sales items transacted.
