# Emails

Metisa allows you to harness the power of predictive insights in email marketing.

Metisa integrates with your favorite email marketing tools. You can test marketing ideas and automate the ones that work to maximise sales. You can create customer segments to target customers based on Metisa's Predictive Insights. You can also send personalised recommendations to each customer.

### How does it work?

1.  Setup strategies: Setup marketing strategies and ideas for different customer segments.
2.  Experiment: Create one-off campaigns to test how each idea contributes to sales.
3.  Automate: Automate strategies that work well and we will schedule your campaigns to maximise sales.

### How is this better than just using my email provider?

Using predictive insights to create customer segments or personalised content statistically increases the likelihood of engagement and conversion. In some instances, predictive insights could give you 2X or more returns. In other words, you get more ROI for the same effort.

Metisa reacts to changes in the market and how your competitors behave. When you have multiple ideas targeting a customer segment, Metisa automatically sends the one with the highest expected ROI. If an idea works in current market conditions, Metisa will send more of it. Likewise, if an idea is losing effectiveness, Metisa will send less of it.

### What is a strategy?

A strategy is a goal you want to achieve on a customer segment, such as activate one-time customers or winback at-risk customers. A strategy contains one or more marketing ideas.

### How do automated strategies work?

By default, campaigns for each strategy are manually created. After you automate an idea, Metisa schedules campaigns automatically.

Campaigns are scheduled a week in advance. In other words, if you start automating an idea on Monday, the first campaign will be sent next week. This gives you time to write the copy for ideas that require action each time.

### What does the action required setting for a strategy mean?

Some strategies cannot be completely automated and need the attention of marketers each time they are sent (e.g. monthly newsletter). Such strategies are marked as action required and require you to amend the subject and content before they are scheduled.

### What is an idea?

An idea is a type of marketing campaign for a strategy. For instance, an idea for a strategy to winback at-risk customers could be a 10% discount. Another idea could be to give customers free shipping on their next purchase when they make their first purchase.

### If I have many ideas for a strategy, will I end up sending multiple emails to customers in the same segment?

No. Metisa will send the idea with highest expected return to each customer for a given strategy.

### Which email providers do you integrate with?

We integrate with Amazon SES and Mailchimp. However, we strongly recommend using Amazon SES to because it is less expensive and gives you more sending options.

### When do you send emails?

We send emails at the time of day and day of week where your customers are most likely to engage.
