### You have integrated - What's next?

Congratulations, that was all you need to do to get set up with Metisa! So, what now?

The moment you successfully integrated, Metisa has started to work on your data, running machine learning algorithms to make sense of your customers. This **analyzing process usually takes less than 15 minutes**, but depending on the amount of data you have (ie. number of sales transactions, customers, products), it can sometimes take up to an hour to finish the process.

Check back in an hour and your Metisa dashboard should be ready to help you supercharge your e-commerce sales. You can login to your Metisa dashboard [here](https://askmetisa.com/login).
