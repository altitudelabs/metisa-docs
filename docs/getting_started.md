# Getting started

1. **Integrate your store.** To analyze your customers, we need access to your store data through one of our [store integrations](integrations.md). Your data is refreshed once daily.

2. **Learn about your customers.** Check out your store [insights](insights.md) to find out what your priorities should be for customer acquisition and retention.

3. **Act.** Create [customer segments](filtering.md), [web widgets](widget.md) and [email campaigns](email.md) with personalized content for your customers to increase the likelihood of sales conversions.

4. **Optimise.** Once you find strategies that work well, let Metisa automate and optimise them for you. Spend your time on strategies rather than execution.
