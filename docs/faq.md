# FAQ

### Q: How does Metisa attribute sales?

There are two ways a sale can be attributed to Metisa. When your customer:
1. Buys a product after clicking a recommendation widget
2. Buys a product after opening an email sent using Metisa

**1. Customer buys through recommendation widget on your store**

When you install a recommendation widget on your store, Metisa tracks the products that your individual customers are browsing. This tracking is at the core of what makes Metisa's recommendations better over time.

When a customer purchases the recommended product from your store during the same session that he/she has browsed a recommended product, that sale will be attributed to Metisa.

**2. Customer buys a product after opening an email**

Embedding product recommendations in email campaigns or autoresponders (eg. in a Receipt autoresponder) is a great way to subtly recommend products that your customers may like.

When a customer sees and opens an email with embedded recommendations and proceeds to shop at your store by clicking on one of the products, any purchase made within the day is attributed to Metisa.

### Q: I'm a Magento / BigCommerce user. What happened to my account and integration with Metisa?

Starting 6 Nov 2017, we no longer support Magento and BigCommerce integrations to Metisa.

Building only for a single platform frees us up from having to maintain multiple implementations of new features as well as having to keep up with the demands of the various platforms. We decided to do this so that our small team can focus on giving the majority of our users, who happen to be on Shopify, the best possible user experience and support.

If you are a Magento or BigCommerce user, this means that your Metisa dashboard and widgets will no longer be updated, and other features will stop working (you would have received an email from us). Please drop us an email if you need help - we feel responsible for helping you move on from here. Thank you for using Metisa.

### Q: Why is the installation process of other widgets different from Magic Widget?

The Magic Widget is different from all the other widgets in terms of its behaviour. Because it hovers at the bottom of the page on any page of your store, Metisa can automatically insert the code into one of your template files on Shopify without worrying about _where_ exactly on the page to insert the code at.

The other widgets, on the other hand, are part of the page’s flow. That means that if Metisa automatically inserts these widget code snippets into a template of your shop, there is a high chance that it will not be inserted at the place (on the page) that you would want it to appear. In order to give you better control to determine where exactly you want these widgets to appear, we opted to not insert code directly for these widgets and let you copy and paste the code to the right place instead.

Once you have inserted the widget code snippet into your store and hit “Save,” refresh the page that you inserted the code into and you should see the widget loaded on your page!
