# FAQ

### Q: How does Metisa attribute sales?

There are two ways a sale can be attributed to Metisa. When your customer:
1. Buys a product after clicking a recommendation widget
2. Buys a product after opening an email sent using Metisa

**1. Customer buys through recommendation widget on your store**

When you install a recommendation widget on your store, Metisa tracks the products that your individual customers are browsing. This tracking is at the core of what makes Metisa's recommendations better over time.

When a customer purchases the recommended product from your store during the same session that he/she has browsed a recommended product, that sale will be attributed to Metisa.

**2. Customer buys a product after opening an email**

Embedding product recommendations in email campaigns or autoresponders (eg. in a Receipt autoresponder) is a great way to subtly recommend products that your customers may like.

When a customer sees and opens an email with embedded recommendations and proceeds to shop at your store by clicking on one of the products, any purchase made within the day is attributed to Metisa.
