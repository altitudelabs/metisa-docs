# Install integrations

Metisa analyzes your store/app data and automatically generates item recommendations using machine learning. You will also have access to detailed insight reports, automated emails, and recommendation widgets to improve your sales, all for free.

If your store is built on our __plugin-supported platforms__, integrating with Metisa takes only a few clicks:

* [Shopify](integrations/shopify.md)
<!-- * [Magento](integrations/magento.md) -->
<!-- * [BigCommerce](integrations/bigcommerce.md) -->
<!-- * [WooCommerce](integrations/woocommerce.md) -->

If you have a store not built on any of the above plugin-supported platforms, or you have a different kind of app, please use these other guides to setup your integration:

* [Custom E-Commerce](integrations/custom-ecommerce.md)
* [Custom Media App](integrations/custom-media-app.md)
