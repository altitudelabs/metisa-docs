# Integrations

Metisa analyzes your customers' purchases and behavior and lets you act on insights by email, SMS and web widgets.

### Store

It takes as little as a few minutes to integrate your store with Metisa. We have plugins for common e-commerce store engines including:

* [Shopify](integrations/shopify.md)
* [Magento](integrations/magento.md)
* [BigCommerce](integrations/bigcommerce.md)

If you use another store engine or have a custom store, please contact us at [support@askmetisa.com](mailto:support@askmetisa.com).

### Email

You can use insights from Metisa to send emails using Mailchimp or Amazon SES. If you use other email providers, you can export customer segments. Find out more [here](email.md#email-integration).

### SMS *(coming soon)*

You will be able to use Metisa to send SMS messages.
